To run:
1. Place all .java files within the same directoy
2. Compile all .java files with the console command "javac *.java"
3. Run the command "java Processor"

Notes:
I have not yet completed question 5 which requires running it until all processes have hit the critical section 100 times and graphing it.
Tweaks to some of the wait timings may be made so that it actually runs fast enoughh to be a reasonable time. Some timekeeping will also likely be added.
In the hardcopy submitted the code shown will reflect the changes made for that as opposed to the digital submission being handed in now.
